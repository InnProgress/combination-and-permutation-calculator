## Usage
Filling data:
- Fill 2 inputs <b>k</b> and <b>n</n> following by two simple rules (according to the formula you selected):
  - N number needs to be bigger than number K (If you are calculating combination)
  - N needs to be bigger or equal to K (If you are calculating permutation)

## Tasks
- [ ] Probably I should make it more comfortable to use, update calculation as user is still writing numbers in inputs without need to click outside of input to update the result
